This move is part of the company's focus on maintaining high-performance talent and managing costs.

This decision was announced during an all-hands meeting by CEO Sundar Pichai, aiming to make the company 20% more efficient amid rising competition in the AI industry. Furthermore, in February 2025, Google introduced a "voluntary exit program" for its U.S. Platforms and Devices team, offering severance packages to employees willing to leave. This initiative follows earlier layoffs and restructuring efforts to streamline operations and enhance efficiency. ​
